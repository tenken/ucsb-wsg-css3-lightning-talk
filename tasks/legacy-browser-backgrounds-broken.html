Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. I am your worst nightmare! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Computer, belay that order. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. and attack the Romulans. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns.
